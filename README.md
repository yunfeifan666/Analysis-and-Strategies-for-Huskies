# Analysis-and-Strategies-for-Huskies

Team strategies are essential to the success of the team, because it automatically
promotes our performance when we are handling with complicated problems.
Therefore, we take football game as an exemplar and choose to analyze the data of
dynamic of the Huskies. To help the head coach train the team more specifically, we
are required to create networks of motif, model the indicators affecting the result of
game, and provide the coach suggestions.
We developed the basic model to analyze the interactions among players and the
influence of each indicators to the result of game. Based on our mode, we made
suggestions for the team coach on strategy choosing for the future seasons.
We build a Ball Passing Network to display the positions of the players, number of
passing between the players, and the performance of each player in the field. Based on
historical research, we mainly focused on detecting 2-node and 3-node motif and
finally found that the subnetwork that occured most frequently is 3-node type 6 motif.
We chose the top 11 players according to their total number of passing in 38 games.
Total ball passing between two players indicated that player F2, M1, and M3 have
more possession percentage, which result in better performance. By analyzing Match 9
and Match 14, we found that Huskies may get better outcome if they change the initial
formation (4,5,1) to more offensive formation when facing different strategies of the
opponents.
We also build the Analysis Hierarchy Process (AHP) model to analyze the influences
of each indicators to the result of game. It shows that the Team Flexibility is the most
important indicator and the Strength of Opponents is less important to the result of the
game and the Passing Strategy is the least important indicator. And within each
indicator, similar passing number for each player, relatively small average time to
generate a passing event, facing the relatively weak team make the major contribution
to win the game.
